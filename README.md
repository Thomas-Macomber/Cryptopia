# Cryptopia
**Me and Seanardo doin some _SUPER_ important crypto shizzle**<br/>
~~It's definitely not illegal~~<br/>
In the words of the man himself:<br/>
>I didn't ask if it was legal, I asked if it was possible.

## So what is this?
**To put it bluntly it's a cryptocurrency bot**<br/>
The end goal of this project is to create a bot that will buy and sell cryptocurrency at a profit.<br/>
The bot itself is written is python and is currently capable of fetching exchange rates for an entered coin pair using Cryptopia's public API.<br/>

### Required files for use:
~~ALL OF THEM~~<br/>
**.ropeproject folder<br/>LogTest.bat<br/>LogTest.py<br/>**
<br/>
Other files are mostly for testing or actually learning how python works so they can be ignored.<br/>
~~Definitely don't check our commit comments~~
